# Portfolio
Some of my projects

1- The crypto project works with times series, displaying an interactive graph in bokeh, and then uses ARIMA and LSTM to predict values.

2- The scanner project creates an interactive map using bokeh for a database with Real Estate Developments in Santiago, Chile. This is a small sample of the database.
